# Structuring a PFI App

Every PFI on the tbDEX network is required to handle its end of the responsibilities as part of each [Message Type](/docs/tbdex/message-types). The tbDEX SDK is organized in such a way that there are three key components you'll be required to implement:

* **A main server entry point** - this will leverage the tbDEX SDK to create an http server subscribed to tbDEX messaging.

* **An exchange API provider** - this class is responsible for implementing the ExchangeApi protocol, which is a common interface for managing the database containing your tbDEX offer, order, quote, close, and RFQ data.

* **An offering API provider** - this class is responsible for implementing the OfferingsApi protocol, which is a common interface for managing the database containing your offerings data. When a Wallet queries your PFI for Offerings, the tbDEX SDK will use the interfaces in this class to automatically handle returning Offerings from your database to the Wallet.


## Main Server Entrypoint

Your main server entrypoint should fulfill the following responsibilities:

* Accept `GET` requests for Offerings and Exchanges data
* Handle submission requests for new `RFQ`, `Order`, and `Close` messages

To begin, you’ll want to configure your server with the required exchange and offerings API providers. We can assume that `ExchangeApiProvider` and `OfferingsApiProvider` are classes that implement the `ExchangeApi` and `OfferingsApi` that you've created:

<Tabs groupId="langauge">
<TabItem label="JavaScript" value="JavaScript">
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kotlin" value="Kotlin">
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs groupId="langauge">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" value="JavaScript">

  ```js
  import { TbdexHttpServer } from '@tbdex/http-server'

  const httpApi = new TbdexHttpServer({ 
    exchangesApi: ExchangeApiProvider, 
    offeringsApi: OfferingApiProvider 
    })
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin" value="Kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  import tbdex.sdk.httpserver.*

  val tbdexServerConfig = TbdexHttpServerConfig(
    port = 8080, 
    exchangesApi = ExchangeApiProvider, 
    offeringsApi = OfferingsApiProvider)
  const httpApi = new TbdexHttpServer(tbdexServerConfig);
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


The [message types](/docs/tbdex/message-types) that are sent from Wallets to PFIs are: `RFQ`, `Order`, and `Close`. 
As a result, you’ll want to ensure that your PFI is programmed to accept those messages and create appropriate messages in response.

<Tabs groupId="langauge">
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" value="JavaScript">

  ```js
  httpApi.submit('rfq', async (ctx, rfq) => {
    await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: rfq as Rfq })
  })

  httpApi.submit('order', async (ctx, order) => {
    await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: order as Order })
  })

  httpApi.submit('close', async (ctx, close) => {
    await ExchangeApiProvider.write({ message: close as Close })
  })

  const server = httpApi.listen(config.port, () => {
    log.info(`Mock PFI listening on port ${config.port}`)
  })
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin" value="Kotlin">

  Your callbacks for each message type should be declared and passed into the <code>TbdexHttpServerConfig</code> parameter ahead of initalization. This can be done as follows:
  ```kotlin
  fun main() {
    // Define your submitCallbacks object to ensure each message is handled
    val submitCallbacks: MutableMap<String, SubmitCallback> = mutableMapOf(
      "rfq" to ::rfqCallback,
      "order" to ::orderCallback,
      "close" to ::closeCallback
    )

    // Set up your server as shown before, just with the new parameter added
    val tbdexServerConfig = TbdexHttpServerConfig(
      port = 8080, 
      submitCallbacks = submitCallbacks,
      exchangesApi = ExchangeApiProvider, 
      offeringsApi = OfferingsApiProvider)
    const httpApi = new TbdexHttpServer(tbdexServerConfig);

    // Call configure() to register your routes and map the callbacks
    httpApi.configure(this)
  }

  fun rfqCallback(call: ApplicationCall, messageKind: MessageKind, offering: Offering?) {
    // RFQ Callback Implementation
  }

  fun orderCallback(call: ApplicationCall, messageKind: MessageKind, offering: Offering?) {
    // Order Callback Implementation
  }

  fun closeCallback(call: ApplicationCall, messageKind: MessageKind, offering: Offering?) {
    // Close Callback Implementation
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now your server is configured with the appropriate routing setup.


## Exchange API Provider

The Exchanges API is the set of methods that deals with reading and writing messages, based on the [ExchangesApi](https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-js/interfaces/_tbdex_http_server.ExchangesApi.html) class. 
Although the interface for `ExchangesApi` only requires read operations, you may find it useful to couple write operations into the class as well. 

Using the sample code above as reference, the submission of `RFQ`, `Order`, or `Close` data will result in the triggering of the Exchange API Provider’s `write()`, while the required methods such as `getOrder()` will serve as read methods. 

As a PFI developer, you’ll be responsible for designing your own data storage and provider to access your data. 
Assuming a generic `dataProvider` class serves as your PFI’s means of accessing your Exchange data, here's an example of a `write()` implementation:


```js
 async write(opts: { message: MessageKindClass }) {
  const result = await dataProvider.insert(
        'exchange',
      {
        exchangeid: message.exchangeId,
        messagekind: message.kind,
        messageid: message.id,
        subject,
        message: JSON.stringify(message)
      });
}  
```


After writing an `RFQ` to the database, you can [create a Quote](/docs/tbdex/pfi/creating-quotes). 
Similarly, after writing an `Order` to your database, you’ll want to ensure you properly [process that Order](/docs/tbdex/pfi/processing-orders).


## Offerings API Provider

The `Offerings` API is the set of methods that deals with reading and writing any offering data, based on the [OfferingsApi](https://tbd54566975.github.io/tbdex-js/interfaces/_tbdex_http_server.OfferingsApi.html) class. Although the interface for `OfferingsApi` only requires to be filled out with read operations, you may find it useful to couple write operations into the class as well. 

Although the Offerings API isn’t directly exposed in the main server entrypoint, it is still used to fetch and write offerings to your PFI's database. 
Here's an example of how to get offerings as specified by the `OfferingsApi` interface:


```js
import { Offering } from '@tbdex/http-server'

async getOffering(opts: {id: string}): Promise<Offering> {
    const [ result ] =  await dataProvider.queryForOffering('offering', opts.id);

    if (!result) {
      return undefined
    }

    return Offering.factory(result.offering)

  }

  async getOfferings(): Promise<Offering[]> {
    const results =  await dataProvider.getOfferings('offering');

    const offerings: Offering[] = []
    for (let result of results) {
      const offering = Offering.factory(result.offering)
      offerings.push(offering)
    }

    return offerings
  }
```


Additionally, you could write `Offerings` into your database:

```js
async create(offering: Offering) {
    let result = await dataProvider.insert(
        'offering',
      {
        offeringid: offering.id,
        payoutcurrency: offering.payoutCurrency.currencyCode,
        payincurrency: offering.payinCurrency.currencyCode,
        offering: JSON.stringify(offering)
      });
  }
```

By implementing the `getOffering()` and `getOfferings()` methods, you'll allow Wallets to get a specific Offering they'd be interested in, or query all your Offerings, respectively. The convenience of the tbDEX SDK is that you aren't required to actually write an API endpoint yourself to handle interfacing with Wallets as the SDK handles it all for you.
